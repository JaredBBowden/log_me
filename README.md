## TODO
* Establish some versioning of the data -- for starters, let's save the last 10
 days of data to a backup file
* Write some tests for this thing
* Can we get images working?
* Find a way to locate and crop faces
* Clean up the README
* Add a guide frame to the images
* Add some github-style commit visualizations
* Return image, so we can save all in one spot
* located to above, add a test mode, that will show you what will be saved, but will not write to file
* Add more user prompts
